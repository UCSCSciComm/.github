A place to store and publish code for interactive charts and maps for Science Notes features and other projects. 

### How to use

- First create a personal GitHub account by clicking the `Sign up` button on the [GitHub home page](https://github.com/). Setting up [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) for your account is *strongly recommended*.
- Share your GitHub user name with Peter Aldhous (paldhous@ucsc.edu)
- Peter will create a repository in this Organization for you with the format `firstname-lastname` (where `firstname` and `lastname` are your names).
- Navigate to your repository online at `https://github.com/UCSCSciComm/firstname-lastname`.
- Click the `Add file` button, then select `Upload file`. Upload the HTML file(s) with your charts or maps and then click the `Commit changes` button.
- If you need to edit your code you’ve uploaded it, delete the file, make any changes on your computer, and reupload it, following the same steps.
- To view your charts and maps online, navigate to `https://UCSCSciComm.github.io/firstname-lastname/filename.html`. 
- To embed your graphic in a code module on Wordpress, use the following iframe code:
    `<iframe src="https://UCSCSciComm.github.io/firstname-lastname/filename.html" width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0"></iframe>` 
(You may need to adjust the height parameter for optimal display.)
